# Customer-Segmentation
K-means clustering is one of the most popular clustering algorithms and usually the first thing practitioners apply when solving clustering tasks to get an idea of the structure of the dataset. The goal of K means is to group data points into distinct non-overlapping subgroups. One of the major application of K means clustering is segmentation of customers to get a better understanding of them which in turn could be used to increase the revenue of the company.
# Results
For computing k-means clustering, the initial cluster centers were chosen and then final stable cluster centers were computed by continuing number of iterations until means had stopped further changing with next iterations.
This convergent condition was also achieved by setting a threshold value for change in the mean.
The final cluster centers contained the mean values for each variable in each cluster. Also, this was interpreted in multi-dimensional projections related to market forecasting and planning.
The optimal K value is found to be 5 using the elbow method.
# Dataset
Used a mall customer segmentation dataset provided by the company and also available on kaggle.
Dataset contains 200 customers information like their Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score.
The dataset is created only for the learning purpose of the customer segmentation concepts , also known as market basket analysis.
